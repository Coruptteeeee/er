        Hey there! You’re in the right place! Welcome to our website! <br>
        Before you scroll any further, we just wanted to take a moment to clear things up and respond to all the questions we came across in the comments under AstronomicalGaming’s (@AstroGaming07) “Bob and Bosip is returning…” video on YouTube. <br>

   <u> First things first— it’s important for people to understand that the original mod and our revival were created by two completely different development teams. <br>

    We kindly ask that people should refrain from any form of harassment— it’s important to separate the art from the artist.</u>

 <span style=" font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
    We had encountered a few issues during our development.
    <br> <br>
 1 - Leaking <br>
 </span>
 <span style=" font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
    We had two former developers in the team who were causing us a fair share of trouble. <br>
    Both of them will not be mentioned who they are, they know what they did. <br>
    <u>They won’t be missed.</u> 
</span>
<br>
<br>

<span style=" font-size: 25px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
2 - Billy Powell <br></span>
 </span>
 <span style=" font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
 
    I need to address what happened and why Billy had called me out. <br>
     I met this guy when Bob and Bosip Week 2’s assets were released to the public after the cancellation, seeing him making the mod, i joined him. <br>
     Unfortunately, the progress was abysmally slow. The development of the mod got paused for a long time and I barely heard about it again. <br> 
     <br>

    But then later on, I saw that Billy posted some videos about Bob and Bosip again, so I decided to get back in. <br>
    But at the time I wasn’t so bright, I couldn’t make music on my own but using AI, which I regret it. <br>
     But it was good talking about the mod. <br>
     <br>

    A while had passed after then I joined with this team. (The Restoration Team) DumbassDerp (The Head Director) had a conversation with the person Billy hates. <br>
    He texted me personally and told me to unfriend Derp. I refused. <br>
    He started to crash out, resulting in this YouTube community post:
<br> <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1285309353490124904/1358842193447616673/image.png?ex=67f54fe8&is=67f3fe68&hm=9558f0350516a83e79daaed5c2c588c6a3edb46a1eb7a22af9b17ade60b2599c&"  width="800" height="250">
 <br>
 <br>
 <u>And please remember this : Restore ≠ Revamped <br>
 Billy’s goal was to reconstruct it. Our goal is to recontinue it.</u>

 2) - Is Amor included? <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1285309353490124904/1358863728610775200/amoralt_scared.png?ex=67f563f7&is=67f41277&hm=d0942800bbd312a0a6742dff7235ff94b59dd51fb105efe7a0bb5f98e57e2be0&=&format=webp&quality=lossless"  width="40" height="40"><br>   </span> 
    <span style=" font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
        Yes. <br>
        The character will be kept solely for story telling purposes. <br>
        Despite the character being the real-life individual representation, his presence is only to serve the role, any replacement is unsuitable and inconsistent. <br>
         We do not support pedophilia. This is our final statement of this question. <br>
</span>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style=" font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
    3) - What engine does our mod run on? <img src="https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.vYZZo637cshzBe--v4knIwAAAA?rs=1&amp;pid=ImgDetMain"  width="40" height="40"> <br>   </span> 
      <span style=" font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
        <u>Codename Engine! </u><br>
        Every assets from the last updates will be ported into this one for more efficient experience and takes up less space from your device! <br>
        <u>Prepare yourselves!</u>
  </span>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>    
  <span style=" font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
  4) - Is our mod considered THE official restoration? <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1285309353490124904/1358864765639856319/bosip_what.png?ex=67f564ee&is=67f4136e&hm=018d15edcd20f77221b8d4262e30dd502dc85ce330b67d12e9eb6b6f85c326c1&=&format=webp&quality=lossless"  width="40" height="40"><br>   </span> 
      <span style=" font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
        This is purely up to personal interpretations. <br>
        <u>As this project is approved by Bluskys, one of the original developers of the aforementioned project.</u>  <br>
        As long as it remains respectful. This will be considered semi-official, as this lacks AmorAltra’s original direction and plans, it is guaranteed to not be 100% accurate.

  </span>
  <br>
  <br> 
  <br> 
  <span style=" font-size: 40px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
    5) - Is there anything really worth restoring?
    <img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1285309353490124904/1358866838276276430/emodog10.png?ex=67f566dc&is=67f4155c&hm=b872f6f6700514b17282a5278f880938993910c3968c2d68863d2821a128ec8c&=&format=webp&quality=lossless"  width="40" height="40"><br>   </span> 
        <span style=" font-size: 15px; font-family: 'Segoe UI', Tahoma, Geneva, Verdana, sans-serif ">
            <u>Well, why not?</u> <br>
            Bluskys had released various cancelled plans featuring the following: <br>
            • Cancelled collaborations with other FNF mods. <br>
            • Bob and Bosip Week 2 (Bobal and Bofo) [The story script is unfinished, we had to take it up from what we got.] <br>
            • Unused content and So Much More! <br>
